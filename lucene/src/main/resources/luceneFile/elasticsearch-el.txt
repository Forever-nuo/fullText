Elasticsearch is a lucene-based search server. It provides a full-text search engine with distributed multi-user capability. It is developed with java based on restful web interface. It is published as an open source code under the terms of apache license. It is a popular enterprise-level search engine. Designed for cloud computing, can achieve real-time search, stability, reliability, speed, easy to install and use. We build a Web site or application and add search features, but it's very difficult to create a search. We want the search solution to run fast, we want a zero configuration and a completely free search pattern, we want to be able to simply use json to index data through http, We want our search server to always be available, we want to be able to start at one and expand to hundreds, we want real-time search, we want simple multi-tenant, we want to build a cloud solution. So we use elasticsearch to solve all these problems and other problems that may arise.
